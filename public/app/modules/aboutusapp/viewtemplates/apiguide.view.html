    <h4>How utilizie the Wizio API</h4>
    <p>
        Currently the Wizio API utilizes an Iframe to play it's Virtual Reality
        player and the virtual reality images. The API works by placing a specific
        URL in the Iframe src attribute. This URL is dynamically generated by the
        Wizio API server upon a proper and validated request.

        The request must be a <strong>GET</strong> request to <strong>api.wizio.co</strong>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here is an example request - A full request will look like the following:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    api.wizio.co/api/vr/listing/46a17cc1-3310-11e6-a0b2-0800274a1eca/175_amory_st_jamaica_plain_ma/2
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    api.wizio.co/api/vr/listing/{apikey}/{apartmentAddress}/{unitNumber}
                </strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        The request can be broken up in the following way, in parameter order
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <u>/api/vr/listing/</u> --- this is a static part of the address. It will
                    always be the same.
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <u>6a17cc1-3310-11e6-a0b2-0800274a1eca</u> --- This is an example API key
                    that you will recieve from us.
                </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <u>175_amory_st_jamaica_plain_ma</u>--- This is the apartment address. The apartment address needs
                </strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            Any spaces to be replaced with '_' (underscores)
                        </strong>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>
                            A nearly complete address. The address does not need country, but it should have at least a street number, a street, a city/town and a state. A zip code is preferrable.
                        </strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    The response from the GET request will look like the following:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>
                http://beta.wizio.co/listing/vr/6f6e7849-a6d5-46be-96a0-6aef59c5ce5d/08518c8d-327f-11e6-a0b2-0800274a1eca
            </strong>
        </li>
    </ul>
    This is the URL that must be placed into the <strong>src</strong> attribute of
    your Iframe. From here the Iframe will take over loading the rest.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Testing the API</h4>
    <p>
        Wizio has test data that you may use for testing to make sure the API is working. Below are the following addresses that test data exists for. To test, you'll want to make the request as noted above in the documentation with some of these hard coded addresses. The request from each of these responses will be a URL. You need to load this URL into the Iframe's <strong>src</strong> attribute on your page.

        <li>101 Monmouth Street boston ma unit number 1</li>
