ACCOMPLISHMENTS
Wizio has received fantastic guidance from Idea, Northeasternâ€™s Venture accelerator.
Idea has been adamant about us testing our value proposition hypothesis as quickly
and cheaply as possible. As a result we have surveyed more than 300 tenants, realtors
and, landlords to learn about the market and where wizio fits. All of our research
and testing was made possible through numerous grants and in kind services:

Cash Grants
Husky Startup Challenge 1st Place Award - $2,000
Idea Prototype Fund - $1,000
Idea Gap Fund - $8,700.00

In-kind gifts
Scout Design Studio - $3,333.00
Morse, Barnes-Brown and Pendleton - $2,5000.00
Northeastern Community Business Clinic - $4,900.00
Amazon Web Services - $15,000.00
We are extremely grateful for the opportunity provided to us by Idea at Northeastern University.
