            <p>Wizio was born from the seed of an idea: freedom of information. As our service transitioned from one iteration to the next, our mission became more clear, but more importantly, the plight of the housing industry and the institutions that uphold and maintain its status quo became more apparent to us. From this knowledge, and the insights we’ve gained working to overcome the challenges of this industry we have identified four principles to strive towards:</p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:150%;">1. Our homes should be our homes. </span>  </p>
            <p>“Our homes should be where we find comfort, enjoyment, and relaxation. Municipalities and local governments have designed housing codes to uphold standards for living conditions, but with an explosive growth in population and housing supply, these codes have become increasingly difficult to enforce with limited budgets. The housing codes designed for tenants’ protection are overlooked, and code violations go unnoticed. Much to our detriment and at no fault of the city, this problem has led to chronic under-management of an increasingly overpriced housing stock. The Wizio platform must bring more accountability and oversight. Whether we work with landlords or city officials, we will develop a system that helps to maintain our homes at the standard dictated by law. </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:150%;">2. People First. </span>  </p>
            <p> We exist to serve, whether it is an employee, prospective tenant, or landlord. Our personal motives are defined by the experiences we have had with flawed apartment searches and living conditions. We identified that others shared this pain and now work tirelessly to address it. We as individuals have a right to find a living space that is comfortable and accommodates our needs. <b> This is a right that should extend to every person in every place. </b> As we grow we look forward to sharing what this means and how we will reflect this value for the most marginalized of Boston’s communities.
 </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:150%;">3. Freedom of Information, if we didn’t make that clear already. </span>  </p>
            <p>Information should be upfront and free to access. Our team believes that complete transparency is a right and we are working hard to make sure that happens, from the lease to first-hand accounts of apartment experiences. This philosophy extends to every aspect of our organization. Have you seen <a href="https://open.buffer.com/introducing-open-salaries-at-buffer-including-our-transparent-formula-and-all-individual-salaries/" target="_blank"> Buffer’s open salary formula </a>? This is one step we have added to our development plan and a great segway into our last point: </p>
            <p><span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:150%;">4. People First. </span>  </p>
            <p> Being a part of the Wizio team is about much more than the extrinsic motivation of financial gain. Our intrinsic motivation is born from a desire to do better and be better. We are defined by the meaning we create for the communities we serve. We have a responsibility to not only those people we aim to serve, but also to our team itself.. It is our goal to support a workforce that feels energized and activated by these same principles, adding value not to a company, but society. Mistakes will happen as we take this journey and we are always looking for ways in which we can take action to improve ourselves. If you have a question or suggestion to help build upon this meaning, please don’t hesitate to reach out.</p>
