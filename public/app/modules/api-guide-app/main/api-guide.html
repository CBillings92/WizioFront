      <h3>Summray</h3>
      <p>The Wizio API allows you to display 360 content on your website dynamically.</p>
      <h3>Utilizing the Wizio API</h3>
      <p>The API utilizes iframes to display Wizio 360 tours. A request must be sent to Wizio's API with an API token, an address and a unit number to receive the dynamically generated link to the tour. Once the link to the tour is received it should be placed in an <code>iframe</code> <code>src</code> attribute. </p>
      <h3>Request</h3>
      <p>The request made to the Wizio API must be a <code>GET</code> request sent to <code>https://api.wizio.co/tour/:apitoken/:address/:unitnumber</code></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>apitoken</code>: Your API token provided by Wizio.</li>
        <li><code>address</code>: Address of the tour you're looking to pull.</li>
        <li><code>unitnumber</code>: Unit number of the tour you're looking to pull.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Response</h3>
      <p>The response from the Wizio API follows the following formats:</p>
      <pre><code>
        {
          status: 'success',
          success: 1,
        }
      </code></pre>

        <h4>How do I utilize the Wizio API?</h4>
        <p>
            A developer, most likely your current website manager/developer, will use your unique API key to send a request to our web application for the apartment address and unit number you are interested in having virtual reality for. Upon receiving a request,
            our web application provides an iframe source, an adjustable window that can be embedded into a web page for viewing the virtual reality content for the specific address requested. The API works by placing a specific URL in an iframe src attribute.
            This URL is dynamically generated by the Wizio API server upon a proper and validated request. The request must be a
            <strong>GET</strong> request to
            <strong>api.wizio.co</strong>.
            <br> Here is an example request - A full request will look like the following:
            <ul class="alternate-text-orange">
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        api.wizio.co/api/vr/listing/46a17cc1-3310-11e6-a0b2-0800274a1eca/175_amory_st_jamaica_plain_ma/2
                    </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        api.wizio.co/api/vr/listing/{apikey}/{apartmentAddress}/{unitNumber}
                    </strong>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br> The request can be broken up in the following way, in parameter order
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        <u class="alternate-text-orange">/api/vr/listing/</u>
                        --- this is a static part of the address. It will always be the same.
                    </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        <u class="alternate-text-orange">6a17cc1-3310-11e6-a0b2-0800274a1eca/</u>
                        --- This is an example API key that you will receive from us.
                    </strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        <u class="alternate-text-orange">175_amory_st_jamaica_plain_ma</u>--- This is the apartment address. The apartment address needs

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>
                                Any spaces to be replaced with '_' (underscores)
                            </strong>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>
                                A nearly complete address. The address does not need country, but it should have at least a street number, a street, a city/town and a state. A zip code is preferable.
                            </strong>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br> The response from the GET request will look like the following:
        <ul class="alternate-text-orange">
            <li>
                <strong>
                    http://beta.wizio.co/listing/vr/6f6e7849-a6d5-46be-96a0-6aef59c5ce5d/08518c8d-327f-11e6-a0b2-0800274a1eca
                </strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        This is the URL that must be placed into the
        <strong>src</strong> attribute of your iframe. From here the iframe will take over loading the rest.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h4>How do I know my key works?</h4>
        <p>
            Wizio has test data that you may use for testing to make sure the API is working. Below are the following addresses that test data exists for. To test, you'll want to make the request as noted above in the documentation with some of these hard coded addresses.
            The request from each of these responses will be a URL. You need to load this URL into the iframe's
            <strong>src</strong> attribute on your page.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>101 Monmouth Street boston ma unit number 1</li>
            <ul class="alternate-text-orange">
