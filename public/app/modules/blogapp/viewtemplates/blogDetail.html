            <i> <br>  Commenting on one of the photo replies, titled: “This Apartment is Trash”, Sam received from his Craigslist post, “This really hurt, I’d like to think my apartment is slightly above trash...maybe like chip crumbs you eat right prior to trash.”</i>

            <p>In a recent interview, small-time landlord Sam Huckabee claims he, “Just wanted to be more authentic with my anonymous Craigslist post to find tenants.”</p>
            <p> In the past, he has relied on realty agencies to help fill his apartment, but Sam claims they often doctor the photos they post online of his apartment, going as far as sending tours next door to “model units” which do not at all reflect his
                apartment.</p>
            <p>“You know, I had realtors take photos, but they just didn’t do my apartment justice. They always avoided the broken windows and the 2-year old hole in the bathroom. They didn’t even want to include Fred in the photos, the homeless guy I gave
                a key to get in and sleep on the couch. He’s awesome!” </p>
            <p>His Craigslist post, titled, “Dilapidated apartment unfit for human habitation seeking tenants,” had an all-time low of 5 replies, none of which turned into tenants.</p>

            <i> <br> One of the photos Sam included in his Craigslist post. “I haven’t had a chance to clean out the bathroom yet, I figure it could be a great bonding experience for the next group of tenants.”</i>
            <hr>
            <p> “I even included a photo of both bedrooms! I wasn’t able to wash off the wall accents from the previous tenants though. Apparently hedonistic blood rituals are a no-go for drywall. </p>
            <p>Sam explained to the Wizio staff-writers that he remains hopeful that his new, candid apartment listing will help him to find a good tenant match. “I had originally planned to start the lease on September 1st, but honestly, I’m in no rush
                and would be happy to find a tenant by the end of November.</p>
